narnia1 will execute the machine code in environment variable EGG.  Although
narnia1 is a suid binary owned by narnia2 it is not sufficient to directly
launch /bin/sh.  This is special for sh (and bash, etc) as it by defaults
resets the effective user euid to the real user ruid on startup. This can be
avoided in two ways:

 - Change the ruid to the euid first and then execve /bin/sh using setreuid.
 - Start in privileged mode with /bin/sh -p

Question: Why do this if you can simply add `-p`?

Using pwntools:

pwn.asm(pwn.shellcraft.setreuid()+pwn.shellcraft.sh())
# Use echo -e to support hex like \xa0
# Use ' and not " to avoid substituting e.g. $
export EGG=$(echo -e '...')
./narnia1
