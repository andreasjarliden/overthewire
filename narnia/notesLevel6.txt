fp BP-0x0C i.e. fp is above on the stack
b1 BP-0x14
b2 BP-0x1C
Possible to overwrite fp
But the if statement means that we let fp point to the stack
But the regular libc functions are not on the stack and loaded elsewhere!
system is at 0xf7dc d430 (by using gdb)
The program has helpfully already set the ruid=euid
It is easy to overflow fp with system by overflowing b1 with 12345678\x30\xd40\xdc\xf7
To get an interactive shell, replace 123...8 with <sh #    >
